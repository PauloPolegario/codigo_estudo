	<h1>The Violas of Rome</h1>
	<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was a dark and stormy night.</p>
	<p>Her heart was racing as she walked towards the stairs. No one would play her viola again. The nightmares would end - tonight.</p>
	<h2>A soldier's tale</h2>
	<p>It all began many years ago, in a small hamlet by the seaside. Her cousins would knock at the door and they'd go into the village to see their aunt at the shop. Never in her life would she suspect that the hamlet would be the very place that they would come first - the druids that came in from the sea.</p>
	<p>That Saturday was Salame and Cheese night. Would she be able to tell her girlfriends the sad truth about her nightmares?</p>
