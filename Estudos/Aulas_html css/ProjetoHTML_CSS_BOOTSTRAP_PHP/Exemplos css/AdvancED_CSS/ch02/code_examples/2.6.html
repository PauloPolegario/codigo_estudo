		<p>The string section as a whole was starting to get ahead of the conductor. Please keep an eye on the tempo changes.</p>
		<p class="violas">The violas really need a sectional or two for the last movement of the shostakovich. Try to get together at least once before the next rehearsal.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="brass">
		<p>Crescendos need to be more gradual throughout. We are getting too loud too early in the last movement.</p>
